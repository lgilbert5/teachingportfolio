Teaching Portfolio
This website was made with the help of an edgecut template file. I added in my own version of the carousel with modified javascript code. 
<p>
I also have working buttons for everything except the email sending and the login. 
On this website, I included a profile photo of myself, multiple lists founds as the navigation bar, images, and videos. </p>

<p> You can also download the PDF with my work from the attached links. 
I also have embedded youtube links, and I have a contact me area which has my phone number and email address listed. 
The website also incorporates smaller icons and links for ease of access and returning to the screens you want to navigate through. </p>
The actual code for the website has been arrranged into various categories and IDs to make it easier to add onto and edit. 
I have also allowed the code to include additional pages in the future if I or someone else wants to edit the page. 

<p> The images in this website are my own creations. The template for the website initially came from Edgecut, which I used and edited with pieces of my own code.
